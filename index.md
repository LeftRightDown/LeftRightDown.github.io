# Welcome to Zachary's Programming Portfolio!


## Projects
Here are some of my works from Programing 101!

### [The Artifact] (https://github.com/LeftRightDown/TheArtifactGame)

A space adventure game created as a midterm project. 

#### *Premise*
In The Artifact, you play as wandering voyager on their way to meet up with a black-market
merchant. When suddenly you receive a distress signal from another ship but upon arrival you 
receive no response. This is where your story begins, exploring an unknown ship as you try to
find any loot before it explodes.
